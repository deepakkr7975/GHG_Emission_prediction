Supply Chain Emissions Modeling Using Industry and Commodity Data (2010–2016)

Problem Statement:
Annual supply chain emission data from 2010–2016 categorized into industries and commodities. The goal is to develop a regression model that can predict the Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins based on descriptive and quality metrics (substance, unit, reliability, temporal/geographical/technological/data collection correlations, etc.).
